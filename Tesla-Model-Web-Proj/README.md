This mock web page is a working project for my 1510 Web Design 1 class for Spring Semester 21. 

These web pages are the basis for a mock Tesla Website for school. The index.html page is my working home page followed by .html files named and created for each named model of vehicle and display their relevant information. 

The two CSS pages are created to have better operability, for both users and developers alike. Mainly for adding styles and situating links in a clear manner for efficient navigation and to also make the individual pages uniform, professional and efficient. I am working on and going to be adding a Cascading style sheet for each individual Web Page, (Home, individual models) so as to have better file dependency. 

Any comments or concerns can be routed to me, Steven Klabunde, at my gmail account: klabunde.b.steven (at) gmail.com. 

All adjustments and edits are uploaded and kept at my repository for school projects, along with other projects, at https://www.github.com/KlondiikeBar
