I created this program using C/C++ on Visual Studio Code and used my gcc compilier on ubuntu 20.8 to compile this application on my command line. 

For Ubuntu Command Line, I had to navigate to my directory where I held the application, CookieRecipe, and used the command "./" to run it. 

I am not to sure as to the process of doing this on Windows if you have it, which it looked liked from your videos. 

I also attached my source code for CookieRecipe, it is cookieRecipe.cc and contains my work. 

If there are any issues what-so-ever, please reach me at my personal email: klabunde.b.steven@gmail.com

Hope this helps in the Kitchen!
