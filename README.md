Cookie-Recipe-Project
Contains a homework project assingment from my programming and logic class. Module 1, and created January 12 2021.
It is designed to be run from the command line where it asks the user to specify how many cookies they would like to bake and then it spits out the measurements for the batch of cookies they requested. 
	Example: "How many cookies would you like to bake today?"
		user input: 48
			The program then evaluates how much sugar, butter and flour the recipe would need to create 84 cookies. 
		output: "Cups of sugar: number"
			"Cups of Butter: number"	
			"Cups of Flour: number"
All source code is in included in the project folder.
